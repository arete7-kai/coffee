This is a database for coffee lovers.
The mission is to help the angel investor (and others with discerning palates) learn about their own
individual bean & roast preferences. 
 
The vision: a personalized, private partner through the fun & tasty journey of experimenting with coffee.

The app user will be logging information about their own coffee purchases and tastings. 
They will then be able to easily find and leverage this trove of data to make informed choices. 

In future versions, the app will integrate with AI to make personalized predictions.
